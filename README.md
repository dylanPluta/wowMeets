# wowMeets

wowMeets is a message board dedicated to World of Warcraft players. with in game being limited to being 'in game' and with the fast scrolling trade chat, it is sometimes hard to be heard or to get meet up with people. wowMeets is here to fill that void. You can post a qustion or ask for help leveling up or trying to trade or any other question or comment about the World of Warcraft here and each post stays up for 12 hours with any activity, so hopefully with in that time someone has gotten back with you.

if you have any questions or concerns please email wowMeets at wowmeetssite@gmail.com
