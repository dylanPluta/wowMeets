            <p>wowMeets is a message board dedicated to 
                           World of Warcraft players. with in game 
                           being limited to being 'in game' and with 
                           the fast scrolling trade chat, it is sometimes
                           hard to be heard or to get meet up with people.
                           wowMeets is here to fill that void. You can post 
                           a qustion or ask for help leveling up or trying 
                           to trade or any other question or comment about the
                           World of Warcraft here and each post stays up for 
                           12 hours with any activity, so hopefully with in that
                           time someone has gotten back with you.
